## Results

the blog that describe the finding can be found 

1. based on the analysis, in the us, longer working hours for professional developer doesn't translate to higher pay. in fact for highly compensated developer the correlation is slightly negative between weekly work hour and compensation.
2. as expected as developer gain more experience, one will work longer hour, probably the responsibility will grow with experience. However, the work hour will
   drop slightly and then around 40 years of experience, the number of work hours jump to much higher value.
3. as expected, the more experience the developer has, the longer they will stay with their current employer
